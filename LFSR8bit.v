	LFSR8bit.v
	Description:
	The 16-bit many-to-one LFSR will continuously iterate from which
	samples will be taken to create the gameâ€™s sequence which the user will decode.
	
	Inputs
		clk: 				On-board 50 Mhz clock
		reset:				active low push button
		
	Outputs
		output_sequence:	Output will cycle between 255 different unique states.
